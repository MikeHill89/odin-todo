#Todo App
Todo's should be dynamically created using constructors/classes or factory
functions

Your todo list should have projects or separate lists of todos. 
When a user first opens the app, there should be some sort of 
‘default’ project to which all of their todos are put. 

Users should be able to create new projects and choose
which project their todos go into.
